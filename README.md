# Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6

A good tutorial from Cory House @ Pluralsight that runs through getting structure and scale to a React & Redux app.

The app also uses Webpack, Babel, ESLint, npm scripts, Mocha, Enzyme, Bootstrap, Toastr and Express.

It also uses files with data to mock a web API.

## Todo:
- Implement tests (both React and Redux)
- Setup for production build
